## Background

I am a freelance mobile developer with experience in building applications for
most platforms. Since graduating from University, I have worked with some of
the biggest brands and agencies in the world, producing hit mobile products or
helping to define mobile strategy.

I have built and released one of the most popular iOS apps in the UK - 0870 - 
which, to date, has saved consumers over Â£11 million. It has been featured in
a wide variety of the UK press, including The Guardian, The Sunday Times, The
Telegraph, T3 Magazine, and many more.

I have been featured in Wired magazine as an iPhone developer "expert", and
have worked with Microsoft in briefing journalists on development during
the Windows Phone 7 launch.
