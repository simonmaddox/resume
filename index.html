<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am a mobile developer with lots of experience in building applications for
most platforms. I have worked with some of the biggest brands and agencies in
the world, producing hit mobile products and helping to define mobile strategy.</p>

<p>I have built and released one of the most popular iOS apps in the UK - 0870 -
which, to date, has saved consumers over &pound;15 million. It has been featured
in a wide variety of the UK press, including The Guardian, The Sunday Times, The
Telegraph, T3 Magazine, and many many more.</p>

<p>I have been featured in Wired magazine as an iPhone developer "expert", and
have worked with Microsoft in briefing journalists on development during
the Windows Phone 7 launch.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Telefonica O2 Ltd</h3>

<h4>Do'er of New Stuff</h4>

<h4>April 2011 - Present</h4>

<p>Working in 'The Lab' to design and build a new communications product for O2.
O2 Connect is a Voice Over IP app for iOS, Android and other platforms (not
announced) which allows users to use their phone for calls, SMS and voicemail
even if they have no signal (everything goes over Wifi).</p>

<p>O2 Connect went from conception to beta launch in under 100 days, required
significant changes to the O2 core network and received lots of positive press.</p>

<p>I am the lead client developer on O2 Connect, and have had a major role in
defining what O2 Connect is and exactly how it works.</p>

<h3>Sensible Duck Ltd</h3>

<h5>May 2007 - August 2009</h5>

<p>While at GoSpoken, I architected and built an e-commerce platform based
around selling various types of literary content to mobile devices,
including e-books, audio books and physical books.</p>

<p>I was required to build a stable infrastructure while could interface with
carrier billing networks and SMS gateways, all while working on as many
devices as possible.</p>

<p>I regularly contributed to the <a href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/">WURFL project</a>
and represented the company at a large number of events and conferences.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, GoSpoken has gone through two multi-million pound
rounds of investment based on the infrastructure that I wrote.</p>
